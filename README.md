Features adaptive difficulty, time manipulation and a modular system to easily add new ships to an existing fleet of seven.

Brief:
I aimed to create a small-scale prototype to test out game-theory in balancing units.
This project was however made open-source to force myself to adhere to good syntax and formatting methods. I tried to create an infrastructure which could easily be added upon or changed by making good use of object inheritance. Units use a basic state machine. The game makes use of the built-in particle system to create vivid, colourful effects.
Started development on 30 June 2021. Made in a two month sprint.
