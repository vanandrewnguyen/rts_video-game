Breakdown
-

The game features:
- Adaptive difficulty
- Time manipulation
- Seven unit types

I no longer wish to make full-scale games anymore, so I aimed to create a small-scale prototype to test out game-theory in balancing units. I never got around to going too in-depth.
This project was however made open-source to force myself to adhere to good syntax and practices. I tried to create an infrastructure which could easily be added upon or changed by making good use of object inheritance. Units use a basic state machine. The game makes use of the built-in particle system to create vivid, colourful effects.
Made in a two month sprint from June 2021.
